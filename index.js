To read is to voyage through time. – Carl Sagan", "A book is a garden, an orchard, a storehouse, a party, a company by the way, a counselor, a multitude of counselors. – Charles Baudelaire", "Literature is the safe and traditional vehicle through which we learn about the world and pass on values from one generation to the next. Books save lives. – Laurie Anderson", "That is part of the beauty of all literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you’re not lonely and isolated from anyone. You belong. – F. Scott Fitzgerald"],
