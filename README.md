## Why a Book Recommendation System ?

1. A book recommendation system can help users discover new and relevant books based on their reading history and preferences.
2. It can provide personalized recommendations to each user, which can make the process of finding a new book to read more efficient and enjoyable.
3. It can help users save time by filtering out books that they are not interested in, and instead presenting them with a curated list of options.
4. It can improve the user's reading experience by providing recommendations for books that are closely related to ones they have already enjoyed.
5. A book recommendation system can also be used to make recommendations to groups of users with similar reading interests, such as a book club or a community of readers with similar tastes.

## About :
Our [book recommendation system](https://arjundotadex.github.io/Book-recommendation-system.github.io/) is a project that was created as part of theÂ SheBuilds hackathon. SheBuilds is a 48-hour gender-focused hackathon with endless creativity. Students are challenged to further what they know by creating projects following their passions. Spending time on projects outside the classroom is the best way to not only learn what you love but also find new interests.

Our team of four highly enthusiastic individuals was inspired by the mission of SheBuilds and decided to focus on creating a tool that could help people discover new and engaging books to read. By leveraging machine learning techniques and a comprehensive dataset of books and user ratings, our book recommendation system is able to provide personalised recommendations to help users find their next great read. We are proud to have been a part of the SheBuilds hackathon and are excited to continue developing and improving our book recommendation system in the future.

**Thank You!**
